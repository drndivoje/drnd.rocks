<div class="content"><p>Here is my first post on this blog and i will keep it short and simple as possible.
Still I do not have interesting topic to write but still I have enough bullets for the first post. 
I had the idea of starting personal web sites almost a decade ago.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>There was an attempt to realise this idea but I gave up after 2 years of producing decent content.
The drnd.rocks is the second try to produce my personal web site which has decent content which represents my thoughts on different topics.</p>
<p>I have decided to build the site as static web site using Zola framework. 
Zola is like Jekyl but written in Rust.
For css I am using bulma.js and fontawsome. Maybe later I would change something since I choose those frameworks if I find something better. 
I am just backend developer and frontend is not something I have enough experience to evaluate different frameworks. In most of cases it is same thing but with the different name.</p>
