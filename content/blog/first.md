For my my first post on this blog I will keep it as short and simple as possible. 

My name is Ivan and I am a Software Developer. I would like to use this space to share my thoughts about things which are part of my life. This includes my work, software development, as well as my hobbies - bicycles, nature, animals, and any other thing that interests me.

 I had the idea of starting personal web site almost a decade ago ({{ link(url="https://drndivoje.wordpress.com/", text="see here") }}). I attempted to realise this idea but I gave up after 2 years of producing content. The drnd.rocks is the second try to produce my personal web site which has content which represents my thoughts on different topics.

I have decided to build the site as static web site using Zola framework. 
Zola is like Jekyl but written in Rust. For css I am using bulma.js and fontawsome. 
If I find something better I may change the frameworks.
I am a back-end developer and front-end is not something I have enough experience in evaluating different frameworks. 
I find that in most of cases it is same thing but with the different name.
